How many different ways can a d-dimensional hypercube be labeled?

---

well since if we have a 1 dimensional hypercube we can label it 2 ways (0-1 or 1-0), and if we
have a 2 dimensional hypercube we can label it 4 ways (0123-1302-2031-3210), im guessing we can label a
d-dimensional hypercube in 2^d ways.
