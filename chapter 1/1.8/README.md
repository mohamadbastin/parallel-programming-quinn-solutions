If the performance of CPUs increases by a factor of 10 every five years,
how long does it take for performance to double?

---

I dont think it works that way but, if we assume that it does,
it increases each year by a factor of x lets say, in x^5 its 10; so whats x?
logx(10) = 5; then x is almost 1.58

so now log1.58(2) is what we want which is almost 1.51.

so it takes roughly one and a half year for it to double.
