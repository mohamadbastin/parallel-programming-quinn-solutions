a. Using the performance of Caltech’s Cosmic Cube and its
Supercomputing ’97 cluster as your guide, estimate the improvement
in microprocessor speeds between 1984 and 1997.
b. Assuming the rate of change in microprocessor performance was
constant between 1984 and 1997, what was the annual microprocessor
performance improvement needed to account for the speed increase
calculated in part a?
