 Suppose we are going to speed the execution of the data clustering
algorithm by using p processors to generate the D-dimensional vectors
for each of the N documents. One approach would be to preallocate
about N/p documents to each processor. Another approach would be to
put the documents on a list and let processors remove documents as fast
as they could process them. Discuss one advantage of each approach.
