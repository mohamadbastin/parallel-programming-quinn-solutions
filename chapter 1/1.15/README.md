Consider the vector-generation step of the data clustering algorithm
described in this chapter. Assume the time required to perform this step is
directly proportional to document size. Suggest an approach for
allocating documents to processors that may avoid the problems
associated with either preallocating N/p documents to each processor or
having processors retrieve unprocessed documents from a central list.
